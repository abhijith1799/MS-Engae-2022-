# Face-Recognition based Authentication-cum-Attendence System

Libraries Used-

CMake 

dlib

face-Recognition

This library is used for encoding the face measurements, and to compare the encodings.


OpenCV

numpy

Django



Languages Used-

Python

HTML

CSS

In this projrct, primary appllication is to perform facial recognition based Authentication-cum-Attendance Register.

step-1
in this entire process is to train the system with images(faces),

step-2

Face-recognition library program encodes faces and save the encodings as matrices
for that we have to gives images of faces to the program.

step-3

program fetches the faces from camera and encodes each frames then compare with the trained image-list if matching is there then it shows a green rectagle in the face, otherwise it will fetch a red rectagle over face.

There are two ways to import the faces for training-
1) By manual folder import 

2) here we provide another functionality to register faces,when we use this camera will pop up and we can capture image, this images tranfered to training.
